<h3 id="what-is-the-compounding-method"><strong>What is the compounding method?</strong></h3>


<p>It basically is a tracking method to make sure you meditate every day be it 5min or 1 hour. The only requirement is that you do it everyday.  You take a calendar and make an X or mark for every day you meditated. The goal is to have as many Xs in a row as you can and not break the link. So if you can meditate everyday this month then you have 30 Xs in a row now that is a great accomplishment. This tactic will help you visually see how well you are doing and keep you motivated to get that X for the day. It will also help you get over that hump when you are starting a new habit. After a few weeks you will be looking forward to meditating and you won’t miss a day. Set goals and rewards for yourself, for example if you get 20 days in a row treat yourself to a night out or that gadget you have been eyeing.   It is the same principle as compounding your money in the bank and investments. As your interest gets interest your money starts to increase exponentially that is the power of compounding.  Think of meditating everyday as investing in your mind and body, the more you do it the more rewards you will reap. The only commitment you need is to set a daily habit.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-you-need-consistency"><strong>Why do you need consistency?</strong></h3>



<p>Consistency is the name of the game for meditation. If you want to experience all the benefits that meditation has to offer all you need to do is meditate there is no way around this. You just have to do it.  I avidly workout at the gym to lift heavy weights and try to gain some muscle ( key word try lol!) I view meditation as working out for your mind and soul. Just like working out in the gym you need to do it consistently to see any visible gains. You are not going to get ripped if go to the gym by doing 5 reps on the bench and 10 squats for only one day a month. That is the same concept with meditation. You most likely won’t see the benefits of meditation if you do not do it at least 3 times per week.  I will be the first to admit that sometimes it is hard to meditate on a daily basis. It might sound lame but sometimes I am too tired to meditate, I rather just veg out after work. I found that by following the compounding method and tracking my progress works for me to help me meditate every day.</p>

<p>If any of you guys work out at the gym you will know what I am talking about. For the first couple of months you are dragging your feet to the gym. After seeing some gains from your workouts you will become hooked and can’t wait to go to gym to reach the next level. Working out won’t be a chore anymore it will be something that you look forward to and never miss by any means. You will actually enjoy the process of working out and performing the exercise. You will give it your all and be totally immersed in trying to lift as much as you can. I sometimes even day dream what exercises and muscles I will train for that day! The best way to meditate is to actually enjoy the process of meditating. Be consistent with your meditation practice and you will start to enjoy the process and see dramatic changes in your life.</p>

<h3 id="the-best-time-tomeditate"><strong>The best time to meditate. </strong></h3>


<p>There is no best time of the day for mediation you can do it when you feel like it. (Then why the hell am I writing about the best time to meditate?) Well if you are having a hard time to meditate everyday then the best time is spend 5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes before you go to sleep, that is more than enough time for your daily practice. Instead of just laying in bed resisting the urge to stay in your cozy bed all you need to do is sit on your bed close your eyes and start meditating. It is a great way to start your day and collect your thoughts so you can conquer the day.</p>

<p>If you are having a hard time going to sleep then meditating when you are trying to go to sleep can help you relax and help you fall asleep. Just lay in bed and observe any thoughts that come to mind as you witness your thoughts you will fall into a deep relaxation and be sound asleep.</p>

<h3 id="psychology-of-compounding"><strong>Psychology of compounding.</strong></h3>



<p>The law of compounding is making small incremental wins everyday that will compound to a large sum with time. By doing one small task a day you exponentially grow and get better at that task. Before you know it a month goes by and you would have meditated for 300minuites. Now that to me sounds insane if I had to meditate for 300 minutes or 5 hours.  But it can be done by just setting aside 10 min per month which is reasonable.  It is a lot easier to make small incremental changes in your lifestyle than make large dramatic ones. It will help you stay on track because it is easy to be consistent.</p>

<p>If you do not have 10 minutes  per day for yourself then be mindful of the things you are doing that day. Ask yourself is what I am doing really that important and  I can’t afford just 10 minutes  from my 1440 minutes day. Set this small goal of 10 minutes per day and I guarantee that you will see profound  benefits in your life in just 1 week.</p>

<p>How do you stay accountable with your daily meditation practice? How many days have you consistently meditated for?</p>
